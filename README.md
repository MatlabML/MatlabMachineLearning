`sklearn`'s counterpart in Matlab language to facilitate coding of machine learning.

The value of `sklearn` that the founder of this repository see in `sklearn` is in
- `sklearn.pipeline` going with `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` toolkits,
- the simplest and througout `fit`, `transform`, and `predict` interface,
- `datasets` facilities,
- and `metrics`.

The founder prioritizes the features above.
